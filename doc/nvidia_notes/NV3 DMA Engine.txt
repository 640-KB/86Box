NV3 DMA Engine
(DirectDraw Driver) 

Initially set CACHES, CACHE1_PULL0, CACHE1_PULL1, CACHE1_DMA0 to 1

Same for other areas

CACHE1_PUSH1 contains CHID

If it's different:

If RmFifoFlushContext failed: Do nothing

Set PULL0, PUSH0, Caches to 1, return false


If it's not:
DMA TLB PTE seems to be 1 for direct programming, maybe RM does it differently
Tag=FFFFFFFF
CACHE1_DMA1 - Number of bytes to send
CACHE1_DMA2 - Get offset 
CACHE1_DMA3 - Bus address space (Area BAR0 mapped to? Or bar1?)

TO START:
To set up DMA for for Cache1 Puller: CACHE1_PULL0 -> 1, changes to 0 when done
To set up DMA Cache1 Push: CACHE1_PULL0 -> 1, changes to 0 when done
Set CACHES to 1

GO: Set DMA0 to 1
